Issues:
- Really Inconsistent
- ImageGen.py not working for some reason(not needed for functionalty as long as text files in latex folder are present)


Fixes?:

- make everything a latex
- idk abt imagegen

Future functionality:
   - Integrate latexocr

 update:
 - scrapped imagegen and pix2txt (ver 0.5) and start using inftyreader to generate tex files
 - turning the input and the mentioned tex files to text before comparing
 - way more consistent

 update 2:
 - returning to using latex but manually cleaning it up (trying to match the input format to the files generated by infty reader)
      - future features:
          - bigger dataset
          - somehow add the ocr to the app
